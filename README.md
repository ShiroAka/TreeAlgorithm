TreeAlgorithm

This project will contain programs in different languages to work with trees based on an unsorted nodes list, where each node contains an id and the id of its parent node.

And an unsorted list with the nodes:

I want to put the nodes in the following structure:

And be able to get the tree's root, and do other things with said tree (e.g.: print the tree in the console)
